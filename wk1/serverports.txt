What is the definition of server port?
A server port is a communication endpoint on a computer or network device that is used for listening for and receiving incoming network traffic. It is a 16-bit unsigned integer that is used to identify a specific process or service running on a host (server) and allows different services to run on the same host while using the same IP address.
When a client (such as a web browser) wants to connect to a server, it specifies the server's IP address and the port number to which it wants to connect. The server then uses the port number to determine which service or process should handle the incoming request. For example, a web server typically listens on port 80 for incoming HTTP requests, while a mail server typically listens on port 25 for incoming email messages.
